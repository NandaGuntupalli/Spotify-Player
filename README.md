# Raspberry Pi Spotify Player

This is a small project that I am currently working on, where I'll be making an mp3 player-like device for my spotify. 
I love to work while having music, but at the same time, I feel I get too distracted in the Spotify UI rather than
actually working. Therefore, I thought of the idea of having this sort of device that has a simple UI that simply
just plays music; no BS and nothing distracting.
